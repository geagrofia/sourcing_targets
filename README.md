# sourcing_targets
Test of targets workflow management in R for African agricultural sourcing

I have a existing repository for creating sourcing areas for agricultural products.
This has a general workflow or pipeline that incorporates land use, administrative boundaries and climate indicators.
The result of the workflow is a map and statistics of each climate indicator for the different sourcing areas.

This repository will implement the targets workflow.
